    * Full marks awarded
  - If similarity score < accuracy tolerance:
    * Partial credit calculation:
      Score = (Similarity Score / Accuracy Tolerance) × Full Marks
    * Example:
      - Full marks: 10
      - Accuracy tolerance: 80%
      - Student similarity: 65%
      - Score: (65% / 80%) × 10 = 8.125 points

Step 4: Teacher Review (Optional)
